# Logistic Regression  

using data on movie collection , carried out exploratory data analysis  

outlier treatment, missing value imputation and adjusting for seasonality in data using descriptive analysis,visualisation tools and numpy using three types of regression:  
- logistic regression
   use of varying levels of predicted classes to create confusion matrix (confusion matrix shows varying the probabilities of true positive and true negatives based on a threshold value)
- K nearest neighbors
- linear discriminant analysis

use of all three models to showcase their use and their differences  
we see that there are minor changes but these results are so for the given dataset alone and are NOT proof of any model being superior in machine learning
